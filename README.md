# Development-Econometrics-Analysis
This is a compilations of data analysis primarily done in R (and some in Python) that I have done while working for the Stanford King Center for Global Development. I've withheld all references to sensitive data. This study in question is investigating the potency of the effects of treatments on informal agricultural traders in Subsaharan Africa as they perculate down the supply chain to the suppliers.
